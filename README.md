# animalBiome-archives
These scripts were written for AnimalBiome (animalbiome.com).

These iPython notebooks were used to analyze sequencing based micro-biome data and associated metadata 
for house cats. They summarize the diversity of gut microbes and generate comparisons between 
individual pets and a range of animals of similar age in the data set. Metadata is from customer 
surveys about the animal's lifestyle and social and emotional attributes. Data is proprietary 
and is not archived here.
